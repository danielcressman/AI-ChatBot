# Refold Mandarin Discord FAQ Bot
This is a chat bot that was created for the Refold Mandarin discord server. It is based on code from the Refold Japanese server's FAQ bot, which is in turn based on code from [this repo](https://github.com/anasselhoud/AI-ChatBot) and the [accompanying blogpost on how to build your own AI chatbot](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-your-own-ai-chatbot-on-discord-c6b3468189f4).
