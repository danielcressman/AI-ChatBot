        "As a general rule, we try not to answer most questions like this in the Discord. Many of us truly believe that the \"accept the ambiguity\" advice of the Refold website is really important. We highly recommend you do your best to constantly hunt for low-hanging fruit. Sentences that with minimal effort (a quick dictionary search) you can understand easily. If it's grammar you don't understand, give it a quick Google search or check on the Chinese Grammar Wiki. If you still don't understand it after that, just move on. The faster you can train your brain to let go of things out of your reach and keep hunting for this low hanging fruit, the quicker you will make progress. Don't obsess over why something is the way it is; just accept it and continue trying to figure it out over time as you get more examples through additional input.\n\nIt's great that you have questions. But Discord/other learners is not where you find answers to those questions. Immersion is where you will find answers to those questions. It's a mindset that will pay dividends as you continue on your journey. Once your brain is primed with a question, it will hunt for the answer in immersion and result in an instinct for the language that no grammar guide, no language learner, and often even, no average native Chinese speaker will ever be able to give you. So, you'll see this a lot, \"the answer is immersion.\" \"Acquire\" the language, don't \"learn\" it.\n\nNote: This applies to any questions about language function. \"How are A and B different? How are A and B the same? Why is A this way? Why isn't B this way?\" Whatever modification to the same exact idea you can think of, the answer is the same. Look it up in a dictionary or Google it. If you still don't understand, just move on and immerse more. You'll be able to understand it at some point down the line.\n\nThis is not because we don't want to answer your question. This is because, it's better for YOU that we don't. Happy immersing!"

You can read the simplified roadmap to start off with, but at some point you should read the detailed roadmap as well.\n\nNext, you'll need to familiarize yourself with Pinyin or Zhuyin (see FAQ #9), tones (see FAQ #4), Anki, etc. (refer to Stage 1 of the Refold Roadmap).\n\nThen, start chipping away at the first 1,000 most frequent words via a foundation Anki deck. We recommend this: Refold Mandarin 1k (only choose 1 of the decks, not both -- see FAQ #8 for the difference between Simplified and Traditional Chinese). For grammar, use the Chinese Grammar Wiki.\n\nNow, familiarize yourself with the wealth of resources available in our Refold Mandarin Resource Doc and Sheet. Other resources are also available in the Media & Resources section of the Discord. Also, read through this entire FAQ before asking questions on the Discord. We'd love to help you, but chances are your question has already been answered in detail in this FAQ.\n\nAfter you have established a routine with Anki, etc., you can then jump into immersion. Shows like Peppa Pig and Comprehensible Input videos might be very useful in the beginning. Meteor Garden (2018) is often recommended as a slice of life show to watch. However, what immersion material you use is entirely up to you and dependent on your own interests. The Resource Doc and Sheet have other suggestions for beginner immersion."

        "First, this depends on what you mean by \"fluent.\" This may sound pedantic, but everyone has a different definition of fluency, so it's important to define it. At Refold we define reaching basic fluency at around a B2 level on the CEFR scale. At that point you will be able to converse with others on a variety of topics without having to resort to using English to get your point across or resolve misunderstandings. If you don't know how to say something in Chinese, you'll be able to use Chinese to explain what you mean. You won't know or be able to use every idiom out there and there will still be a ton of words for you to learn, especially from novels and other high-level immersion sources or more specialized domains (science, medicine, etc.). Reaching basic fluency is like getting a black belt in martial arts -- it takes a lot of time and it's a respectable accomplishment, but it's still only the beginning in a life-long journey to true mastery (near-native proficiency in a language learning context).\n\nHaving said all that, you should know that the more time you spend immersing, the quicker you'll reach your goals. We recommend spending at least 2 hours per day immersing, as we don't know anybody who has reached fluency in a reasonable amount of time with less than 2 hours per day. Based on the FSI estimates, with 2 hours per day of immersion it'd take approximately 3 years to get a solid B2 level of fluency."

        "In Mandarin there are 4 tones (plus the neutral tone). Tone is a feature of the language where the pitch you use to pronounce a syllable changes the meaning of that syllable. For example, Ma  is pronounced with the first tone as ma and means \"mother\", Ma  is pronounced with the second tone as ma and means \"hemp\", Ma  is pronounced using the third tone as ma and means \"horse\", Ma  is pronounced using the fourth tone as ma and means \"scold\", Ma  is pronounced using the neutral tone as ma and is a grammatical particle used to ask questions. See this video for a demonstration of the different tones.\n\nYes, you have to learn them. You sometimes will hear foreigners who claim that \"you don't have to learn tones because people will understand you based on the context.\" At times, this is true -- even if you use the wrong tone, people might still understand you. At other times, this is not true and you will not be understood. It is suggested you do not listen to people who tell you that tones aren't important or that you can just ignore tones. 9 times out of 10 these people have poor Mandarin language abilities themselves. Tones are a core part of the language."

        "At the beginning it may seem easy -- no conjugations! No cases! Etc. However once you reach an advanced level, you'll realize that Chinese grammar is not as easy as it once may have seemed. At advanced levels, it's not uncommon to come across essays or novels that are influenced by Wen Yan Wen  (Literary Chinese/Classical Chinese), for example. A lot of Chinese grammar is simplistic but it is not easy. Simple does not necessarily equate with easy, and at times it can even make things a lot harder.\n\nPeople who claim Chinese grammar is easy usually are people who have never reached a truly high level in the language and whose own Chinese grammar is replete with grammatical mistakes, or, far less commonly, are people who have already reached a very high level in the language and have forgotten about the difficult aspects of the grammar because they've been immersed in the language for so long and it's almost second nature to them at this point.\n\nNaturally expressing yourself in Chinese will require you to think in a completely different way compared with your native language. Avoid thinking in English/your native language and translating that directly into Chinese in your head when outputting. Do not fall into the trap of \"speaking English using Chinese words.\""

        "Simplified Chinese is used in Mainland China, Singapore, and Malaysia. Traditional is used in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao. Simplified Chinese simplified certain characters, typically by reducing the stroke count. For example, \"study\" in Simplified Chinese is written Xue  while in Traditional Chinese it is written as Xue  . The sentence, \"I am a student\" is written in Simplified Chinese as Wo Shi Xue Sheng , and in Traditional Chinese as Wo Shi Xue Sheng  . You can see that most characters are the same, but one is different. This is because not all characters were simplified in Simplified Chinese, only a portion of them were.\n\nAs you can see, the difference between Simplified and Traditional Chinese only concerns the writing system, and has nothing to do with spoken Mandarin.\n\nStart off by only studying the character set based on what you want to learn (Mainland Chinese Mandarin, or Taiwanese Mandarin).\n\nWhen you reach an advanced level in Mandarin, you can study the opposite set. Natives will be able to read both character sets (although they might struggle with a few characters or read a little more slowly in the character set which is opposite to what they are used to)."

See a full list of the radicals here. Contrary to popular belief, characters are not made up of radicals. Rather, radicals are just as their Chinese name indicates -- \"(dictionary) section headers.\"\n\nIt is still recommended that you eventually study radicals, as natives will often use informal radical names (Su Cheng ) to describe character components in conversations.\n\nFor more information on radicals, we recommend you watch this short video and read this article for an overview from an expert on Chinese characters on why radicals are not, in fact, the \"building blocks\" of characters, but rather, sound and meaning components are.\n\nAdvanced Answer:\n\n\"Radical\" can mean one of four things:\n\n1) Pian Pang  (meaning radical Xing Pang  sound radicalSheng Pang ) which only applies to phono-semantic characters Xing Sheng Zi  (the majority of characters), like Bao , Shuo , Chi , Dai .  This is the original purpose of 'radical'. e.g. for Kuo :  Men   , She , San , Huo \n\n2) Bu Jian  best translated to components, probably the thing people first think of when saying 'radical' or 'component'. Just anything that seems meaningful that is a smaller part of the character. (Has a more rigorous definition, but unimportant)\n\n3) Bu Shou  or indexing components for a list or dictionary. The Bu Jian  designated as special by the list/dictionary author. Modern Chinese dictionaries are indexed in two ways: alphabetically (for the equivalent pinyin) and by Bu Shou . Only one per character.\n\n4) same  as 2) just in the context of Liu Shu , a way to categorise all Yi Zi  by how characters they were created. This is what the Outlier Linguistics people are talking about, although they are taking a slightly different approach to its explanation. The phono-semantic type of character (Xing Sheng Zi ) is one of the six Shu  mentioned in 1).\n\n(Four of the six Shu  are important)"

Read a line, then listen to it, then read the next, then listen to it. This can be a really great way to build a foundation in the language. Many people seem to find a  2/3  reading to  1/3  listening balance to be effective for themselves.\n\nEven while doing your listening, aiding comprehension via having Chinese subtitles on while listening is sometimes recommended.

        "Most video games are not as valuable for language learning because the language density is low. You can also enjoy games without understanding what is being said at all. But if you're gonna spend your time playing games, you might as well do it in your target language. Just don't expect significant language gains from this. The exceptions are visual novels (which in many cases can be just as complex as regular novels), and some RPGs. All games are different though, so use your own judgement. In general you want immersion sources with as much language density as possible. Over time, it really does matter.\n\nThat being said, if you are going to play video games, having passive immersion in the background can help. When the game provides little to no active immersion, switching focus to your passive immersion can increase your overall language exposure. It's not as good as language-dense active immersion, but it helps."

        "This depends on how high of a level you want to reach in the language. Even in modern novels, essays, and in some games and TV shows, there will be descriptions, dialogue, etc. which exhibit great influence from Classical/Literary Chinese. Maybe at stage 3 or 4 you should consider starting to learn it."

        "Heisig is no longer officially recommended by Refold. Rather, we suggest you use a vocab deck with 1000 or so foundational words, along with audio and example sentences. We have a deck like that, and more info about that deck can be found under FAQ Question #2. For the reasons why we recommend using such a deck, please see Matt's video on the JP1K deck -- although that video is about the Refold Japanese deck, the core principles still apply to the Mandarin deck.\n\nHaving said all that, some Refolders still find doing a few hundred characters of Heisig (in addition to doing a vocab Anki deck) to be helpful in learning how to break characters down into components. Do this if you want, but it's not required."
