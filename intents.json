        "As a general rule, we try not to answer most questions like this in the Discord. Many of us truly believe that the \u201caccept the ambiguity\u201d advice of the Refold website\u00a0is really important. We highly recommend you do your best to constantly hunt for low-hanging fruit. Sentences that with minimal effort (a quick dictionary search) you can understand easily. If it\u2019s grammar you don\u2019t understand, give it a quick Google search or check on the Chinese Grammar Wiki. If you still don\u2019t understand it after that, just move on. The faster you can train your brain to let go of things out of your reach and keep hunting for this low hanging fruit, the quicker you will make progress. Don't obsess over why something is the way it is; just accept it and continue trying to figure it out over time as you get more examples through additional input.\n\nIt's great that you have questions. But Discord/other learners is not where you find answers to those questions. Immersion is where you will find answers to those questions. It's a mindset that will pay dividends as you continue on your journey. Once your brain is primed with a question, it will hunt for the answer in immersion and result in an instinct for the language that no grammar guide, no language learner, and often even, no average native Chinese speaker will ever be able to give you. So, you'll see this a lot, \u201cthe answer is immersion.\u201d \u201cAcquire\u201d the language, don't \u201clearn\u201d it.\n\nNote: This applies to any questions about language function. \u201cHow are A and B different? How are A and B the same? Why is A this way? Why isn't B this way?\u201d Whatever modification to the same exact idea you can think of, the answer is the same. Look it up in a dictionary or Google it. If you still don\u2019t understand, just move on and immerse more. You\u2019ll be able to understand it at some point down the line.\n\nThis is not because we don't want to answer your question. This is because, it's better for YOU that we don't. Happy immersing!"

        "First, go to the #start-here channel in Discord, give yourself the Stage 0 role, and also read through the other messages in that channel to familiarize yourself with our server\u2019s events/clubs.\n\nThen, start off by reading through the Refold Roadmap.The roadmap explains the various stages of Refold and what you should be doing at each stage. You can read the simplified roadmap to start off with, but at some point you should read the detailed roadmap as well.\n\nNext, you'll need to familiarize yourself with Pinyin or Zhuyin (see FAQ #9), tones (see FAQ #4), Anki, etc. (refer to Stage 1 of the Refold Roadmap).\n\nThen, start chipping away at the first 1,000 most frequent words via a foundation Anki deck. We recommend this: Refold Mandarin 1k\u00a0(only choose 1 of the decks, not both \u2014 see FAQ #8 for the difference between Simplified and Traditional Chinese). For grammar, use the Chinese Grammar Wiki.\n\nNow, familiarize yourself with the wealth of resources available in our Refold Mandarin Resource Doc\u00a0and Sheet. Other resources are also available in the Media & Resources section of the Discord. Also, read through this entire FAQ before asking questions on the Discord. We\u2019d love to help you, but chances are your question has already been answered in detail in this FAQ.\n\nAfter you have established a routine with Anki, etc., you can then jump into immersion. Shows like Peppa Pig and Comprehensible Input videos might be very useful in the beginning. Meteor Garden (2018) is often recommended as a slice of life show to watch. However, what immersion material you use is entirely up to you and dependent on your own interests. The Resource Doc and Sheet have other suggestions for beginner immersion."

        "First, this depends on what you mean by \u201cfluent.\u201d This may sound pedantic, but everyone has a different definition of fluency, so it\u2019s important to define it. At Refold we define reaching basic fluency at around a B2 level on the CEFR scale. At that point you will be able to converse with others on a variety of topics without having to resort to using English to get your point across or resolve misunderstandings. If you don\u2019t know how to say something in Chinese, you\u2019ll be able to use Chinese to explain what you mean. You won\u2019t know or be able to use every idiom out there and there will still be a ton of words for you to learn, especially from novels and other high-level immersion sources or more specialized domains (science, medicine, etc.). Reaching basic fluency is like getting a black belt in martial arts \u2014\u00a0it takes a lot of time and it\u2019s a respectable accomplishment, but it\u2019s still only the beginning in a life-long journey to true mastery (near-native proficiency in a language learning context).\n\nHaving said all that, you should know that the more time you spend immersing, the quicker you\u2019ll reach your goals. We recommend spending at least 2 hours per day immersing, as we don\u2019t know anybody who has reached fluency in a reasonable amount of time with less than 2 hours per day. Based on the FSI estimates, with 2 hours per day of immersion it\u2019d take approximately 3 years to get a solid B2 level of fluency."

        "In Mandarin there are 4 tones (plus the neutral tone). Tone is a feature of the language where the pitch you use to pronounce a syllable changes the meaning of that syllable. For example, \u5988 is pronounced with the first tone as m\u0101 and means \u201cmother\u201d, \u9ebb is pronounced with the second tone as m\u00e1 and means \u201chemp\u201d, \u9a6c is pronounced using the third tone as m\u01ce and means \u201chorse\u201d, \u9a82 is pronounced using the fourth tone as m\u00e0 and means \u201cscold\u201d, \u5417 is pronounced using the neutral tone as ma and is a grammatical particle used to ask questions. See this video\u00a0for a demonstration of the different tones.\n\nYes, you have to learn them. You sometimes will hear foreigners who claim that \u201cyou don\u2019t have to learn tones because people will understand you based on the context.\u201d At times, this is true \u2014\u00a0even if you use the wrong tone, people might still understand you. At other times, this is not true and you will not be understood. It is suggested you do not listen to people who tell you that tones aren\u2019t important or that you can just ignore tones. 9 times out of 10 these people have poor Mandarin language abilities themselves. Tones are a core part of the language."

        "At the beginning it may seem easy \u2014\u00a0no conjugations! No cases! Etc. However once you reach an advanced level, you\u2019ll realize that Chinese grammar is not as easy as it once may have seemed. At advanced levels, it\u2019s not uncommon to come across essays or novels that are influenced by \u6587\u8a00\u6587 (Literary Chinese/Classical Chinese), for example. A lot of Chinese grammar is simplistic\u00a0but it is not easy. Simple does not necessarily equate with easy, and at times it can even make things a lot harder.\n\nPeople who claim Chinese grammar is easy usually are people who have never reached a truly high level in the language and whose own Chinese grammar is replete with grammatical mistakes, or, far less commonly, are people who have already reached a very high level in the language and have forgotten about the difficult aspects of the grammar because they\u2019ve been immersed in the language for so long and it\u2019s almost second nature to them at this point.\n\nNaturally expressing yourself in Chinese will require you to think in a completely different way compared with your native language. Avoid thinking in English/your native language and translating that directly into Chinese in your head when outputting. Do not fall into the trap of \u201cspeaking English using Chinese words.\u201d"

Once you get to an advanced level, feel free to start consuming content from the opposite region in order to familiarize yourself with the differences, if you want. See this Wiki page\u00a0for more info on the differences.Also (and this point this has nothing to do with the spoken language), but Mainland China uses Simplified characters while Taiwan uses Traditional characters (see FAQ #8 for more info).

        "Simplified Chinese is used in Mainland China, Singapore, and Malaysia. Traditional is used in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao. Simplified Chinese simplified certain characters, typically by reducing the stroke count. For example, \u201cstudy\u201d in Simplified Chinese is written \u5b66 while in Traditional Chinese it is written as \u5b78 . The sentence, \u201cI am a student\u201d is written in Simplified Chinese as \u6211\u662f\u5b66\u751f, and in Traditional Chinese as \u6211\u662f\u5b78\u751f . You can see that most characters are the same, but one is different. This is because not all characters were simplified in Simplified Chinese, only a portion of them were.\n\nAs you can see, the difference between Simplified and Traditional Chinese only concerns the writing system, and has nothing to do with spoken Mandarin.\n\nStart off by only studying the character set based on what you want to learn (Mainland Chinese Mandarin, or Taiwanese Mandarin).\n\nWhen you reach an advanced level in Mandarin, you can study the opposite set. Natives will be able to read both character sets (although they might struggle with a few characters or read a little more slowly in the character set which is opposite to what they are used to)."

        "Simple Answer:\n\nThe concepts of radicals, or \u90e8\u9996, (literally \u201csection headers\u201d), was invented in order to organize Chinese characters for the Shuowen Jiezi.Radicals are components shared by various characters. See a full list of the radicals here. Contrary to popular belief, characters are not made up of radicals. Rather, radicals are just as their Chinese name indicates \u2014\u00a0\u201c(dictionary) section headers.\u201d\n\nIt is still recommended that you eventually study radicals, as natives will often use informal radical names (\u4fd7\u79f0)\u00a0to describe character components in conversations.\n\nFor more information on radicals, we recommend you watch this short video\u00a0and read this article\u00a0for an overview from an expert on Chinese characters on why radicals are not, in fact, the \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d of characters, but rather, sound and meaning components are.\n\nAdvanced Answer:\n\n\u201cRadical\u201d can mean one of four things:\n\n1) \u504f\u65c1 \uff08meaning radical \u5f62\u65c1 sound radical\u58f0\u65c1\uff09 which only applies to phono-semantic characters \u5f62\u58f0\u5b57 (the majority of characters), like \u62a5\u3001\u8bf4\u3001\u6301\u3001\u5f85. \u00a0This is the original purpose of 'radical'. e.g. for \u9614: \u00a0\u95e8 \u00a0\u3001\u820c\u3001\u6c35\u3001\u6d3b\n\n2) \u90e8\u4ef6 best translated to components, probably the thing people first think of when saying 'radical' or 'component'. Just anything that seems meaningful that is a smaller part of the character. (Has a more rigorous definition, but unimportant)\n\n3) \u90e8\u9996 or indexing components for a list or dictionary. The \u90e8\u4ef6 designated as special by the list/dictionary author. Modern Chinese dictionaries are indexed in two ways: alphabetically (for the equivalent pinyin) and by \u90e8\u9996. Only one per character.\n\n4) same \u00a0as 2) just in the context of \u516d\u4e66, a way to categorise all \u6c49\u5b57 by how characters they were created. This is what the Outlier Linguistics\u00a0people are talking about, although they are taking a slightly different approach to its explanation. The phono-semantic type of character (\u5f62\u58f0\u5b57) is one of the six \u4e66 mentioned in 1).\n\n(Four of the six \u4e66\u00a0are important)"

        "Through your language learning journey, you should pretty much always be doing both. However, because reading allows you to slow down the language into manageable chunks, generally reading is where significant gains are made. Listening is often about learning to hear that which you already learned by reading. In the beginning, using tools like Language Reactor\u00a0can allow you to read subtitle files of shows. Read a line, then listen to it, then read the next, then listen to it. This can be a really great way to build a foundation in the language. Many people seem to find a \u2154 reading to \u2153 listening balance to be effective for themselves.\n\nEven while doing your listening, aiding comprehension via having Chinese subtitles on while listening is sometimes recommended. Once you have a 3 or 4 comprehension in a piece of content when listening with subs on, try challenging yourself more by removing the subs completely when working on listening."

Many of us feel that Anki is very helpful as it helps accelerate the learning process. However it is not a substitute for immersion. In fact several of our members who achieved fluency never used Anki, or did not start using it until they had already achieved fluency. The SRS is a supplement to immersion, don't get caught in the trap of thinking it's the main part. Reading is like a natural SRS and is far more important. The diagram below also illustrates how some members view the usefulness of Anki \u2014\u00a0as a beginner Anki will be helpful in learning foundational vocab, as you reach an intermediate level it becomes less useful and you\u2019ll be getting a ton of natural SRS from your immersion anyway (but you should still keep your Anki habit up, as doing your reviews should only take 10\u201320 minutes per day anyway), and once you reach an advanced/fluent level, it becomes useful in helping you learn rarer vocabulary you encounter in your immersion."

If you just got started with using Anki, it\u2019ll seem relaxed at first. But to see what your review load will be in 2 weeks, you can either multiply your new card number by 7 to see what the load will be (for example, if you are doing 10 new cards per day, you\u2019ll be doing somewhere around 70 reviews per day after 2 weeks), or use the Anki Simulator addon\u00a0to check."

The exceptions are visual novels (which in many cases can be just as complex as regular novels), and some RPGs. All games are different though, so use your own judgement. In general you want immersion sources with as much language density as possible. Over time, it really does matter.\n\nThat being said, if you are going to play video games, having passive immersion in the background can help. When the game provides little to no active immersion, switching focus to your passive immersion can increase your overall language exposure. It's not as good as language-dense active immersion, but it helps."

        "Heisig is no longer officially recommended by Refold. Rather, we suggest you use a vocab deck with 1000 or so foundational words, along with audio and example sentences. We have a deck like that, and more info about that deck can be found under FAQ Question #2. For the reasons why we recommend using such a deck, please see Matt\u2019s video\u00a0on the JP1K deck \u2014 although that video is about the Refold Japanese deck, the core principles still apply to the Mandarin deck.\n\nHaving said all that, some Refolders still find doing a few hundred characters of Heisig (in addition to doing a vocab Anki deck) to be helpful in learning how to break characters down into components. Do this if you want, but it\u2019s not required."
