      "This is a complicated question that depends on a lot of things. But here is the basic answer.\n\n **Stage 1 - basic**\n I recommend just becoming familiar with pitch accent. Understand it as a concept and know what it is to be aware of it as you immerse. This alone will be incredibly valuable even if you don't go any further with it. Such a small investment can really add up over time, so we recommend doing at least this.\n\n **Stage 1 - A little more**\nIf you arent feeling overwhelmed, and want to take it a bit further, then I recommend learning the pitch patterns and training your ear to hear them in words. Linked below are resources for learning basics about pitch accent and a website to help do maybe 5-10 min a day of basic pitch listening practice.\n\n **Stage-2 - If you dare**\n Once you are in stage 2, you can take it a bit further by starting to learn the pitch for the words you are learning in Anki. The most consuming part about learning pitch accent is learning the pitch of the individual words, so starting to test the pitch of a word in the SRS is something you can start in stage 2. Don't worry about adding this extra level of difficulty earlier. The words you learned up till now are so common they should be easy to fill in later. \n\n **Stage 3 - Ready to Output**\n In stage 3, once you are ready to start outputting, you can get more serious about pitch. Head on over to <#781673820544172034> and ask how to level up your pitch accent when starting to output."

      "It is complicated to answer how long it takes before you understand the language or become fluent. It depends on so many things. How much you immerse, your natural ability, how much time you invest, how focused and how quality the time you spend is, and more. For things like slice-of-life anime, if you immerse a lot in it, it will be quite manageable for you long before fast-paced, mumbled YouTube videos or complex comedy skits. \n\nMy advice is this. Don't focus on how long it will take. Instead, focus on investing time per day. Make that time quality. Stick to it and enjoy your immersion. No matter who you are, it will take a long time to reach a high level in your language. And no amount of worrying about it will make it go faster. So let go of expectations and requirements, investing the time, enjoying that time, making that time focused quality time, and let the progress unfold as it does. The only thing I can promise is, immersion learning is the best way to reach a high, natural level in the language.\n\nFor some rough benchmarks, ask me the related question below so you can figure out a very rough benchmark on time to progress relation."

However, if you NEED to take a Japanese class, we recommend that you immerse as much as you can in your free time to help counter act some of the negative effects this \"skill based language learning\" can have."

      "As a general rule, we try not to answer most questions like \"what does X mean\", \"What is the difference between A and B\" and other variations on this in the discord. Many of us truly believe that the \"accept the ambiguity\" advice of the Refold website is really important. We highly recommend you do your best to constantly hunt for low-hanging fruit. Sentences that with minimal effort (a quick dictionary search) you can understand easily. The faster you can train your brain to let go of things out of your reach and keep hunting for this low hanging fruit, the quicker you will make progress. Don't obsess over why something is the way it is; just accept it and continue trying to figure it out over time as you get more examples through additional input.\n\nIt's great that you have questions. But discord/other learners is not where you find answers to those questions. Immersion is where you will find answers to those questions. It's a mindset that will pay dividends as you continue on your journey. Once you brain is primed with a question, it will hunt for the answer in immersion and result in an instinct for the language that no grammar guide, no language learner, and often even, no native Japanese speaker could ever properly explain to you. So, you'll see this a lot, \"the answer is immersion\". \"Acquire\" the language, don't \"learn\" it.\n\nNote: This applies to any questions about language function. \"How are A and B different? How are A and B the same? Why is A this way. Why isn't B this way.\" Whatever modification to the same exact idea you can think of, the answer is the same. \"Immerse more\".\n\nThis is not because we don't want to answer your question. This is because, it's better for YOU that we don't. Happy immersing \ud83d\ude42"

While it's roots come from AJATT, we believe that AJATT is an old, out-of-date, and antiquated language learning method. Many aspects of AJATT are inefficient or unnecessary. You, of course, can read up on AJATT if you want and take whatever lessons you want from that, but in the end, it's not as good as what we are developing here."

      "I don't know. Probably by translating things and getting someone to look over y our translations and critique them. Refold is not bout translating. It's about building instincts in the language, so you process Japanese as base meaning and avoid translating all together. Once your instincts are high enough, translating should be a pretty easy skill to develop."

      "Watching native language content and speaking your native language while learning a second language is fine for most people. It's unrealistic to expect you to cut out your native language from life 100%. The point is to try and continue finding ways to add more Japanese language exposure without negatively impacting things that are more important (such as health, relationships, job, school, etc.). So don't feel guilty about enjoying a movie in English every now and then. Just try your best to get as much exposure as you can. (It won't cause damage per say, but just removes time you could be spending with your Target Language. This time adds up in the long run, so you want to try ur best to remove it as much as you can and replace it with time in your Target Language. But we are all human, so be kind to yourself.)"

      "The entire Refold Method and most of the resources are free. You don't need any money to learn a language, but it can help make it more convenient if you invest a little money. Netflix is an example of a service that many find very worth the small monetary investment. The Refold JP1K deck also is an example of premium content that many seem to find worth investing in. But, if you want to learn a language for $0, that is 100% possible. Read the Refold website, read the free guides, watch the free videos, check out the community document with all kinds of resources available (mostly free), and more. You will have a more challenging time finding paid content than free content, so just browse around. A great place to start is <#784120941650509865>. I've also linked some things below."
