      "Until stage 2, we recommend not worrying about domains but just follow whatever interests you most. If you ever get sick of a domain, feel free to stray or widen the domain.\n\nDomains are not hard-coded things, but just a concept we created to help section of the language. Anything could be a domain. Anime would be a very wide domain. Drama, horror, fantasy could all be domains but also somewhat broad. Slice of life is a common first domain as it generally deals with the common language used in everyday speech. High school stories with girl protagonists that take place in Tokyo would be a somewhat small domain. The more narrow your domain, the faster you will feel comfortable in it, and the quicker you will reach that level 4 level 5 comprehension ideal for immersion. But also, the more potential there is for becoming sick of the content. So really balancing this is up to you. How small can you make a domain to make good progress, compared to how motivated can you stay.\n\nAs always, remember to prioritize motivation and interest. You will still make progress even if you never stick to a domain. It will just be slower. But slower, enjoyable progress is always better than quicker agonizing progress. And in reality, the fact that you don't enjoy the content anymore will most likely make the more efficient path actually take longer and become less efficient, so don't force a domain too much."

      "Tolerating ambiguity is the acceptance that you won't understand everything. And not only that, but early on, you won't understand A LOT. You must be okay with this. Refold works on finding low-hanging fruit. Hunting down elements of the language that are within your grasp to obtain and understand. To do this, you have to sift through a lot of stuff that is NOT within your range. If you waste time trying to grasp these concepts and understand everything, you will drastically slow down your progress. By accepting ambiguity and being okay with not understanding, you maximize your gains in the language. I've linked an article and a video down below that further explains the importance of accepting ambiguity. This is a crucial concept to understand. I recommend going through both these resources."

If you have some stuff you feel is in your range, go for it, but Refold focuses on finding little chunks of comprehensible input. Sentences here and there. Words here and there. Focus more on finding the content you are interested in and engaged by more so than content in your range. For some people, that interest comes from being comprehensible. For others, it comes from following a subject. Whatever works for you, try and follow it, but don't procrastinate too much by overhunting that perfect piece of content.

Matt, the creator of Refold, has used immersion to reach incredibly high levels in Japanese, along with thousands of others. If Immersion works is not the question.

      "Stage 2C, other than Stage 4, which is ongoing, is generally by far the longest stage in Refold. This is where you take your comprehension in your first domain from comprehension level 3 up to comprehension 5 or 6. There is a lot of vocabulary, phrases, sentence structures, and more in between you and the end of this stage, so it takes a long time. On top of that, you are learning increasingly less common vocabulary, so you will come across each word you learn less and less often. This can make progress feel non-existent even though, in actuality, you are continuing to make significant progress. It can take years, depending on you and your time invested. Patience is the key to making it through this stage, but know you are not alone. Everyone has to trudge through this desert, and the oasis at the end will be all that more satisfying because of the challenge. Sadly there is not trick to make this stage faster other than, just immerse more."
